        <p>
            I am taking this course because I would like to pursue a career in Web Development.

            Some extra things about me is that in my spare time I like to play video games, watch movies, and listen to music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USY2aUSaqwc&ab_channel=SonyaBelousova%26GionaOstinelli-Topic" target="_blank">This</a> is a link to a song I am currently listening to. It is an OST from a Netflix series based on the anime "One Piece."
